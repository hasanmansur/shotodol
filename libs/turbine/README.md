Turbine
========

[Turbine](vsrc/Turbine.vala) is a _Fiber_ collection that integrates the platform thread library. An application may contain only main thread which can perform _Fiber_  collection without the need of _Turbine_ . Otherwise if it contains multiple threads, it will need _Turbine_ to create them.
