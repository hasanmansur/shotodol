Shotodol analogy to functional mathematics
==========================================
In functional mathematics we define a function `f(x,y,z)` to be a relation between the _domains_ of _x_,_y_ and _z_ and the range of `f(x,y,z)`. Here shotodol can be defined like the following,

> shotodol = f(x,y,z, ...) where x,y and z are the extension points.

These extension points can be defined by plugins.
