Shotodol analogy to functional mathematics
==========================================

In functional mathematics we define a function f(x,y,z) to be a relation between the domains of x,y and z and the range of f(x,y,z). Here shotodol can be defined like the following,

> shotodol = f(x,y,z, ...) where x,y and z are the extension points.

These extension points can be defined by plugins.
