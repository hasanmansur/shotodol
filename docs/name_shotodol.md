What the word shotodol means?
==============================

The name is inspired by a famous [lyrics](http://www.bangla-kobita.com/nazrulislam/mora-jhonjhar-moto-uddam/)

> বন্ধনহীন জন্ম–স্বাধীন, চিত্ত মুক্ত শতদল

by [Kazi Nazrul Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazi_Nazrul_Islam). The words say that [we are] 'born free and unbound, like the open-hearted lotus(/water lily)'. For this project, the lyrics means it is **flexible** and does not impose too much restrictions to module writers. And this flexibility is achieved by the **seperation of concern** in the modules like that of the petals of a lotus flower.

There are other projects based on flowerly names, for example, [netscape](http://isp.netscape.com/), inkscape. See also, [the book of mozilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mozilla)
