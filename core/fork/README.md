Fork
========

The idea of fork is to create new process and make them available as worker to the parent process. This helps to implement the actor model of concurrency.

The process have the following properties.
- The process by definition does not share the memory with others( other processes ).
- The processes may communicate with pipes and they may keep contact with the parent console.
